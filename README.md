# ReWear-Community-Clothing-Exchange
Problem Statement 3 â€“ ReWear: Community Clothing Exchange
ReWear is a web-based platform designed to reduce textile waste and promote sustainable fashion by enabling users to exchange unused clothing. The platform allows for two types of exchanges: direct user-to-user swaps and point-based redemptions. Users can browse available items, upload their own listings, and manage exchanges, all while contributing to an eco-friendly lifestyle. The system includes user authentication, item listings, a personal dashboard, and an admin panel to monitor and moderate activities.
